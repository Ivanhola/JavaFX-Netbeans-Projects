# JavaFX Projects that I have created from scratch

In this repository you will find projects that I have worked on using JavaFX.

Everything in these projects are topics, and things that I fully understand in JavaFX, whether it is a project that I have created by following online guides/tutorials, or a project that I create by myself, all lines of code are fully understood and documented by me. 

# Installation instructions can be found in the README on each project
